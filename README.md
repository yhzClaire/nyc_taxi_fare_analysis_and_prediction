Regression Models:
+ Linear Regression
+ Decision Tree
+ Random Forest

# Project Goals
There are two goals of this project. The first goal is to identify any trends and patterns in New York City taxi fares. If we are able to discover any significant findings from the data, we can make recommendations to taxi drivers on how to boost their daily earnings. Second goal is to build regression models to predict taxi fares based on a number of factors (time, date, pickup and dropoff locations and etc.) If the models are of high quality (able to predict well on training, validation and test data), we can learn from the models to see what features contribute to higher taxi fares.

# Hypothesis 
My hypothesis is NYC xaxi fares are affective by pick-up and drop-off locations, passenger count, trip distance, pick-up and drop-off time during the day, day of the week, and whether it is an airport trip. We will exam this hypothesis through data exploratory analysis and building linear model 

# Data
The data we will be analyzing is NYC Yellow Taxi Trips for Januray, April, July, October in 2019
